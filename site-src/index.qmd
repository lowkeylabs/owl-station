**Retirement Options and Outcomes Studies Tool**

**ROOST** (Retirement Options and Outcomes Studies Tool) evaluates **retirement decision policies**—not just static plans—by comparing how **agent-controlled actions** perform under **uncertainty** when those decisions are revisited annually.

ROOST is designed to answer questions like:

> *“Given the uncertainty I face, how flexible are my retirement decisions—and which decision policies are most robust?”*

It does this by organizing retirement analysis around a small number of clear, orthogonal concepts.

## **Core Concepts**

ROOST introduces six key concepts in extending the work of OWL.

* **Decision options** define *what question is being asked*
* **Choice templates** define *policy alternatives*
* **Cases** define *initial conditions and constraints*
* **Runs** define *a fixed decision policy applied to a case*
* **Trials** define *individual realizations of uncertainty*
* **Results** provide *evidence for comparison and insight*

Cases and runs are shared between OWL and ROOST. They are represented by exactly the same files and outputs.

### Decision Options

A **decision option** represents a focused retirement question—something the agent can choose and re-choose over time.

Examples:

* Roth conversion strategy
* Spending policy
* Social Security claiming strategy
* Retirement timing
* Asset allocation policy

Each decision option defines a **policy dimension** to be explored, not a single action.

### Choice Templates

A **choice template** is a concrete **decision policy** within a decision option.
It defines a rule for choosing an action each year, conditional on the current state.

Examples:

* *Roth options*:
  * No Roth conversions
  * Fixed annual conversion amounts
  * Fill to a target marginal tax bracket
  * Let OWL optimize Roth conversions
* *Spending options*:
  * Fixed real spending
  * Guardrail spending
  * Utility-maximizing spending
  * “Smile” spending profile

Choice templates are **reusable**, **comparable**, and represent different ways to answer the same underlying decision question.

### Cases

A **case** defines the **initial state and constraints** of a retirement scenario.

A case is specified by:

* A TOML plan file
* A referenced Household Financial Profile (HFP) file

Cases encode **exogenous assumptions** that the agent does not directly control, including:

* Longevity assumptions
* Rates of return and inflation assumptions
* Tax rules and policy parameters
* Household structure, income sources, and contribution rules

These values are treated as **given** for a case and are held fixed when comparing decision policies.

Cases are **sources of truth** and are independent of computed outcomes.

### Uncertainty

**Uncertainty** represents aspects of the world that affect outcomes but are **not controlled by the agent**.

In ROOST, uncertainty is treated as **exogenous**:

* Longevity outcomes
* Market return paths
* Inflation paths (future implementation)
* Policy and tax environments (future implementation)

Decision policies are evaluated *conditional on uncertainty*, allowing ROOST to explore sensitivity and robustness without conflating choices with outcomes.

This separation allows ROOST to answer questions such as:

* *How sensitive is a decision policy to different longevity outcomes?*
* *Which policies remain robust across pessimistic and optimistic return environments?*

The key conceptual distinction is simple:

> **Decisions are chosen by the agent; uncertainty is not.**

### Runs

A **run** represents a fixed **decision policy instance** applied to a single **case**.

Conceptually:

```
Case × Choice Template → Run
```


A run answers the question:

> *“What decision policy are we studying?”*

All agent-controlled decisions are fixed at the run level.

### Trials

A **trial** represents a single **realization of uncertainty** for a given run.

Conceptually:

```
Run × Uncertainty Realization → Trial
```


Across trials:

* The **decision policy is fixed**
* Only **random or uncertain elements differ**

Trials allow ROOST to distinguish **decision quality** from **luck**, and to evaluate how the same policy performs across many plausible futures.

### Runs vs Trials

Runs and trials serve different but complementary roles:

* A **run** defines *intent* — the policy being evaluated
* A **trial** defines *experience* — what happened under a particular realization of uncertainty

Multiple trials may be generated for a single run to assess robustness, tail risk, and sensitivity to uncertainty.

### Results

**Results** are the artifacts produced by OWL and ROOST for runs and trials and form the basis for evaluation and comparison.

Examples include:

* Objective values (e.g., maximum sustainable spending, bequest)
* Effective (post-override) TOML and HFP artifacts
* Summary and metrics JSON files
* Time-series projections and distributions
* Comparative tables and visualizations

Results are fully reproducible from the effective TOML and HFP combined with the recorded uncertainty realization.

## How the Pieces Fit Together

* **Decision options** define *what question is being asked*
* **Choice templates** define *policy alternatives*
* **Cases** define *initial conditions and constraints*
* **Runs** define *a fixed policy applied to a case*
* **Trials** define *realizations of uncertainty*
* **Results** provide *evidence for comparison and insight*

In short:

> **Decision options define the questions;
> choice templates define the policies;
> cases define the assumptions;
> runs define the fixed policy instances;
> trials define realized uncertainty;
> results define the evidence.**

## **Design Philosophy**

ROOST treats retirement planning as a **sequential decision problem**:

* Decisions are agent-controlled
* They are revisited annually
* Outcomes unfold under uncertainty
* Policies are evaluated across many plausible futures for robustness, not just optimality

Rather than asking *“What is the single optimal plan?”*, ROOST helps answer:

> *“Which decision policies perform well across many plausible futures—and how much flexibility do I really have?”*

## **Relation to OWL-Planner**

### OWL-Planner

**OWL-Planner** (Optimal Wealth Laboratory) is a retirement planning and optimization framework that computes optimal retirement strategies over a full planning horizon, subject to detailed tax rules, account constraints, longevity assumptions, and return scenarios.

Given a fully specified input case—defined by a TOML plan file and a referenced Household Financial Profile (HFP)—OWL solves for optimal actions (such as spending levels, asset allocation, and Roth conversions) under the assumed conditions.

OWL answers questions of the form:

> *“Given these assumptions and constraints, what strategy is optimal over the planning horizon?”*

### How ROOST Extends OWL

**ROOST does not replace OWL.**  Instead, ROOST extends OWL by systematizing how retirement decisions are explored, compared, and interpreted under uncertainty.

In particular, ROOST introduces a structured framework for:

1. Separating agent-controlled decisions from uncertainty
2. Organizing analysis around decision policies rather than single optimized plans
3. Evaluating robustness across many uncertainty realizations
4. Systematically comparing alternative policies

### When to Use OWL vs ROOST

**OWL and ROOST are complementary tools**, designed to answer different—but closely related—questions.

#### Use **OWL-Planner** when you want to:

* Solve a **single, well-defined retirement case**
* Compute an **optimal strategy** under fixed assumptions
* Explore detailed tax, account, and timing constraints

#### Use **ROOST** when you want to:

* Compare **decision policies**, not just one plan
* Explore **robustness and flexibility** under uncertainty
* Systematically evaluate *families of strategies*
* Understand sensitivity to first-year decisions

### In One Sentence

> **Use OWL to compute optimal strategies for a given case;
> use ROOST to compare and understand decision policies across uncertainty.**
