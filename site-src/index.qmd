title: OWL-Station
---

**OWL-Station** is a research and experimental design framework built on top of [Optimal Wealth Laboratory (OWL)](https://github.com/mdlacasse/Owl).

OWL-Station does **not** replace OWL.  OWL-Station is **not** a retirement planner.

Instead, OWL-Station provides an infrastructure for **designing, executing, and analyzing controlled experiments** that use OWL as the core optimization engine.

## How OWL and OWL-Station Differ


| Tool                                | Purpose                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OWL (Optimal Wealth Laboratory)** | Optimizes a *single* retirement scenario under a specified set of assumptions |
| **OWL-Station**                     | Designs and executes *experiments* that systematically vary those assumptions |

Put simply:

> **OWL optimizes retirement scenarios.
> OWL-Station studies the sensitivity of those optimizations.**
