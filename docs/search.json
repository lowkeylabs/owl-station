It uses rigorous mathematical optimization to generate optimal realizations of a financial strategy under a given set of assumptions.\nOWL:\n\nOptimizes a single plan\nUses linear programming\nSolves for either:\n\nmaximum net spending, or\nmaximum after-tax bequest\n\nApplies detailed constraints involving:\n\ntaxes\nRoth conversions\nSocial Security\nMedicare and IRMAA\n\nRe-optimizes under each scenario rather than simulating fixed behavior\n\nOWL is a laboratory instrument, not a prescriptive planner."

What can be done is to understand how sensitive optimal decisions are to changes in assumptions.\nOWL already enables this at the single-scenario level.\nOWL-Station enables it systematically.\nExamples:\n\nComparing retirement outcomes across historical market regimes\nTesting “near-worst-case” sequences vs average conditions\nStudying stochastic rate distributions with known statistical properties\nEvaluating how optimal Roth conversion strategies change under different assumptions\nMeasuring probabilities of success across thousands of optimized futures"
