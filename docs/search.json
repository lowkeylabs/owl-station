    "text": "Retirement Options and Outcomes Studies Tool\nROOST (Retirement Options and Outcomes Studies Tool) evaluates retirement decision policies—not just static plans—by comparing how agent-controlled actions perform under uncertainty when those decisions are revisited annually.\nROOST is designed to answer questions like:\n\n“Given the uncertainty I face, how flexible are my retirement decisions—and which decision policies are most robust?”\n\nIt does this by organizing retirement analysis around a small number of clear, orthogonal concepts.\n\n\nROOST introduces five key concepts in extending the work of OWL.\n\nDecision options define what question is being asked\nChoice templates define policy alternatives\nCases define assumptions and a snapshot of uncertainty\nRuns define a policy instance applied to a case\nResults provide evidence for comparison and insight\n\nCases and runs are shared between OWL and ROOST. They are represented by exactly the same files and outputs.\n\n\nA decision option represents a focused retirement question—something the agent can choose and re-choose over time.\nExamples:\n\nRoth conversion strategy\nSpending policy\nSocial Security claiming strategy\nRetirement timing\nAsset allocation policy\n\nEach decision option defines a policy dimension to be explored, not a single action.\n\n\n\nA choice template is a concrete decision policy within a decision option. It defines a rule for choosing an action each year, conditional on the current state.\nExamples:\n\nRoth options:\n\nNo Roth conversions\nFixed annual conversion amounts\nFill to a target marginal tax bracket\nLet OWL optimize Roth conversions\n\nSpending options:\n\nFixed real spending\nGuardrail spending\nUtility-maximizing spending\n“Smile” spending profile\n\n\nChoice templates are reusable, comparable, and represent different ways to answer the same underlying decision question.\n\n\n\nA case defines the initial state and constraints of a retirement scenario. It is specified by:\n\nA TOML plan file\nA referenced Household Financial Profile (HFP) file\n\nCases encode exogenous assumptions that the agent does not directly control, including:\n\nLongevity assumptions\nRates of return and inflation assumptions\nTax rules and policy parameters\nHousehold structure, income sources, and contribution rules\n\nThese values are treated as given for a case and are held fixed when comparing decision policies.\nCases are sources of truth and are independent of computed outcomes.\n\n\n\nUncertainty represents aspects of the world that affect outcomes but are not controlled by the agent.\nIn ROOST today, uncertainty is represented implicitly and scenario-based:\n\nLongevity and return paths are specified ex ante in the case\nEach case corresponds to a particular realization or assumption set\nDecision policies are evaluated conditional on those assumptions\n\nROOST compares decision policies under a given uncertainty model, rather than attempting to predict which uncertainty will occur.\nThis separation allows ROOST to answer questions such as:\n\nHow sensitive is a decision policy to different longevity assumptions?\nWhich policies remain robust across pessimistic and optimistic return scenarios?\n\nFuture extensions may introduce richer stochastic or multi-path representations of uncertainty, but the conceptual separation remains the same: decisions are chosen; uncertainty is not.\n\n\n\nA run is the application of a single choice template to a single case, producing one realization of outcomes under the case’s uncertainty assumptions.\nConceptually:\nCase × Choice Template → Run\n\n\n\nResults are the artifacts produced by OWL for a run and form the basis for evaluation and comparison.\nExamples:\n\nOptimal objective values (max spending, bequest, etc.)\nEffective (post-override) TOML and HFP artifacts\nSummary and metrics JSON files\nTime-series projections and distributions\nComparative tables and visualizations\n\nResults are fully reproducible from the effective TOML and HFP alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision options define what question is being asked\nChoice templates define policy alternatives\nCases define assumptions and a snapshot of uncertainty\nRuns define a policy instance applied to a case\nResults provide evidence for comparison and insight\n\nIn short:\n\nDecision options define the questions;\nchoice templates define the policies;\ncases define the assumptions and a snapshot of uncertainty;\nruns define the policy instance applied to a case;\nresults define the evidence of a run.\n\n\n\n\nROOST treats retirement planning as a sequential decision problem:\n\nDecisions are agent-controlled\nThey are revisited annually\nOutcomes unfold under uncertainty\nPolicies are evaluated for robustness, not just optimality\n\nRather than asking “What is the single optimal plan?”, ROOST helps answer:\n\n“Which decision policies perform well across many plausible futures—and how much flexibility do I really have?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOWL-Planner (Optimal Wealth Laboratory) is a retirement planning and optimization framework that computes optimal retirement strategies over a full planning horizon, subject to detailed tax rules, account constraints, longevity assumptions, and return scenarios.\nGiven a fully specified input case—defined by a TOML plan file and a referenced Household Financial Profile (HFP)—OWL solves for optimal actions (such as spending levels, asset allocation, and Roth conversions) under the assumed conditions. OWL’s strength lies in its rigorous optimization engine and its ability to reason consistently across time, taxes, and multiple interacting constraints.\nOWL answers questions of the form:\n\n“Given these assumptions and constraints, what strategy is optimal over the planning horizon?”\n\n\n\n\nROOST does not replace OWL. Instead, ROOST extends OWL by systematizing how retirement decisions are explored, compared, and interpreted under uncertainty.\nIn particular, ROOST introduces a structured framework for:\n\nExplicitly separating agent-controlled decisions from external uncertainty\nOrganizing retirement analysis around decision policies rather than single optimized plans\nComparing alternative decision policies in a reproducible, scalable way\n\nWhile OWL focuses on computing optimal outcomes for a single, fully specified case, ROOST focuses on exploring decision flexibility and robustness across multiple choices and assumptions.\n\n\n\n1. Decision-centric framing\nROOST treats retirement planning as a sequence of agent-controlled decisions—such as spending, Roth conversions, or claiming Social Security—that are revisited annually. These decisions are represented as decision options, each supported by multiple choice templates (policy rules).\nThis framing makes explicit that:\n\nDecisions are chosen by the agent\nThey can be discrete or continuous\nThey are evaluated as policies, not one-time actions\n\n2. Explicit treatment of uncertainty\nIn ROOST, uncertainty is treated as exogenous:\n\nLongevity assumptions\nReturn and inflation paths\nTax and policy environments\n\nThese elements are encoded in cases and are not directly controlled by the agent. Decision policies are evaluated conditional on this uncertainty snapshot, allowing ROOST to explore sensitivity and robustness without conflating choices with outcomes.\n3. Systematic comparison of alternatives\nROOST introduces structure around OWL runs by:\n\nApplying multiple choice templates to one or more cases\nExecuting these runs in a consistent, reproducible manner\nCapturing comparable results and artifacts for analysis\n\nThis enables ROOST to answer questions such as:\n\nWhich decision policies perform best under a given set of assumptions?\nHow sensitive are outcomes to different first-year decisions?\nWhere does meaningful flexibility exist across plausible futures?\n\nBelow is a respectful, balanced “When to Use OWL vs ROOST” section you can append immediately after “How ROOST Extends OWL” in the new Relation to OWL-Planner section. It is careful to position ROOST as complementary, not superior, and to emphasize OWL’s strengths clearly.\n\n\n\nOWL and ROOST are complementary tools, designed to answer different—but closely related—questions in retirement planning.\n\n\n\nSolve a single, well-defined retirement case\nCompute an optimal strategy under a specific set of assumptions\nExplore the implications of detailed tax, account, and timing constraints\nGenerate a best-response plan given fixed inputs\n\nOWL is ideal when the question is:\n\n“Given these assumptions, what strategy is optimal over the planning horizon?”\n\nOWL’s optimization engine is the authoritative source for computing internally consistent, horizon-wide solutions.\n\n\n\n\nCompare multiple decision policies, not just a single optimized plan\nExplore trade-offs and robustness across alternative choices\nUnderstand decision flexibility under uncertainty\nSystematically evaluate families of strategies (e.g., Roth policies, spending rules, claiming strategies)\nOrganize and automate reproducible experiments across cases and choices\n\nROOST is ideal when the question is:\n\n“Across plausible decision policies and assumptions, which choices perform well—and how sensitive are outcomes to what I decide today?”\n\nROOST builds on OWL by running it repeatedly in a structured way, making comparisons explicit and interpretable.\n\n\n\nA typical workflow looks like:\n\nDefine a case (TOML + HFP)\nUse ROOST to explore and compare decision policies\nUse OWL outputs to understand the mechanics and outcomes of each policy\nFocus decision-making on policies that appear robust and flexible\nOptionally, refine or deepen analysis in OWL for a specific scenario\n\nIn this sense:\n\nOWL provides the optimization engine\nROOST provides the experimental framework\n\nROOST does not replace OWL’s role; it amplifies its usefulness by placing individual OWL runs in a broader decision-analysis context.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse OWL to find optimal strategies for a given case; use ROOST to compare and understand decision policies across uncertainty.\n\nThis distinction keeps each tool focused on what it does best, while allowing them to work together naturally.\n\n\n\nIn short:\n\nOWL computes optimal strategies for a given case\nROOST compares decision policies across cases to understand trade-offs, uncertainty, and flexibility\n\nROOST builds on OWL’s optimization engine by providing the conceptual structure and tooling needed to explore retirement decisions as they are actually faced: sequentially, under uncertainty, and with multiple plausible policies under consideration."
