    "text": "Core Concepts\nROOST introduces six key concepts in extending the work of OWL.\n\nDecision options define what question is being asked\nChoice templates define policy alternatives\nCases define initial conditions and constraints\nRuns define a fixed decision policy applied to a case\nTrials define individual realizations of uncertainty\nResults provide evidence for comparison and insight\n\nCases and runs are shared between OWL and ROOST. They are represented by exactly the same files and outputs.\n\nDecision Options\nA decision option represents a focused retirement question—something the agent can choose and re-choose over time.\nExamples:\n\nRoth conversion strategy\nSpending policy\nSocial Security claiming strategy\nRetirement timing\nAsset allocation policy\n\nEach decision option defines a policy dimension to be explored, not a single action.\n\n\nChoice Templates\nA choice template is a concrete decision policy within a decision option.\nIt defines a rule for choosing an action each year, conditional on the current state.\nExamples:\n\nRoth options:\n\nNo Roth conversions\nFixed annual conversion amounts\nFill to a target marginal tax bracket\nLet OWL optimize Roth conversions\n\nSpending options:\n\nFixed real spending\nGuardrail spending\nUtility-maximizing spending\n“Smile” spending profile\n\n\nChoice templates are reusable, comparable, and represent different ways to answer the same underlying decision question.\n\n\nCases\nA case defines the initial state and constraints of a retirement scenario.\nA case is specified by:\n\nA TOML plan file\nA referenced Household Financial Profile (HFP) file\n\nCases encode exogenous assumptions that the agent does not directly control, including:\n\nLongevity assumptions\nRates of return and inflation assumptions\nTax rules and policy parameters\nHousehold structure, income sources, and contribution rules\n\nThese values are treated as given for a case and are held fixed when comparing decision policies.\nCases are sources of truth and are independent of computed outcomes.\n\n\nUncertainty\nUncertainty represents aspects of the world that affect outcomes but are not controlled by the agent.\nIn ROOST, uncertainty is treated as exogenous:\n\nLongevity outcomes\nMarket return paths\nInflation paths (future implementation)\nPolicy and tax environments (future implementation)\n\nDecision policies are evaluated conditional on uncertainty, allowing ROOST to explore sensitivity and robustness without conflating choices with outcomes.\nThis separation allows ROOST to answer questions such as:\n\nHow sensitive is a decision policy to different longevity outcomes?\nWhich policies remain robust across pessimistic and optimistic return environments?\n\nThe key conceptual distinction is simple:\n\nDecisions are chosen by the agent; uncertainty is not.\n\n\n\nRuns\nA run represents a fixed decision policy instance applied to a single case.\nConceptually:\nCase × Choice Template → Run\nA run answers the question:\n\n“What decision policy are we studying?”\n\nAll agent-controlled decisions are fixed at the run level.\n\n\nTrials\nA trial represents a single realization of uncertainty for a given run.\nConceptually:\nRun × Uncertainty Realization → Trial\nAcross trials:\n\nThe decision policy is fixed\nOnly random or uncertain elements differ\n\nTrials allow ROOST to distinguish decision quality from luck, and to evaluate how the same policy performs across many plausible futures.\n\n\nRuns vs Trials\nRuns and trials serve different but complementary roles:\n\nA run defines intent — the policy being evaluated\nA trial defines experience — what happened under a particular realization of uncertainty\n\nMultiple trials may be generated for a single run to assess robustness, tail risk, and sensitivity to uncertainty.\n\n\nResults\nResults are the artifacts produced by OWL and ROOST for runs and trials and form the basis for evaluation and comparison.\nExamples include:\n\nObjective values (e.g., maximum sustainable spending, bequest)\nEffective (post-override) TOML and HFP artifacts\nSummary and metrics JSON files\nTime-series projections and distributions\nComparative tables and visualizations\n\nResults are fully reproducible from the effective TOML and HFP combined with the recorded uncertainty realization."

    "text": "Relation to OWL-Planner\n\nOWL-Planner\nOWL-Planner (Optimal Wealth Laboratory) is a retirement planning and optimization framework that computes optimal retirement strategies over a full planning horizon, subject to detailed tax rules, account constraints, longevity assumptions, and return scenarios.\nGiven a fully specified input case—defined by a TOML plan file and a referenced Household Financial Profile (HFP)—OWL solves for optimal actions (such as spending levels, asset allocation, and Roth conversions) under the assumed conditions.\nOWL answers questions of the form:\n\n“Given these assumptions and constraints, what strategy is optimal over the planning horizon?”\n\n\n\nHow ROOST Extends OWL\nROOST does not replace OWL. Instead, ROOST extends OWL by systematizing how retirement decisions are explored, compared, and interpreted under uncertainty.\nIn particular, ROOST introduces a structured framework for:\n\nSeparating agent-controlled decisions from uncertainty\nOrganizing analysis around decision policies rather than single optimized plans\nEvaluating robustness across many uncertainty realizations\nSystematically comparing alternative policies\n\n\n\nWhen to Use OWL vs ROOST\nOWL and ROOST are complementary tools, designed to answer different—but closely related—questions.\n\nUse OWL-Planner when you want to:\n\nSolve a single, well-defined retirement case\nCompute an optimal strategy under fixed assumptions\nExplore detailed tax, account, and timing constraints\n\n\n\nUse ROOST when you want to:\n\nCompare decision policies, not just one plan\nExplore robustness and flexibility under uncertainty\nSystematically evaluate families of strategies\nUnderstand sensitivity to first-year decisions\n\n\n\n\nIn One Sentence\n\nUse OWL to compute optimal strategies for a given case;\nuse ROOST to compare and understand decision policies across uncertainty."
